One part of the group was responsible for our code, and another part was responsible for the report and AI code.
The development process included one person sharing the screen with others giving ideas on how to write code.

Main differences between our code and AI's code:

- function read_file:
The main difference in this function is that AI wraps the part in which movies are filtered by year in try-except
structure to deal with ValueError if it occurs.

Also, AI’s code returns a cleaner, more consistent structure for each row by building a formatted row that includes
validated year and rating data


- top_n function
In the genre filtering part we used a for-loop while AI used list comprehension method.

In actor rating calculation we created a dictionary called «actors» to store the highest rating for each actor
by iterating over all movies. In AI's version, instead of precomputing and storing these ratings, it calculates
the highest rating for each actor only when needed using a helper function (get_actor_highest_rating).
Also, our code sorts film_tuples alphabetically by title, and then by average rating in descending order.
AI’s code combines these two sorting criteria by using a lambda function:

results.sort(key=lambda x: (-x[3], x[0]))

AI also converts movie genres to lowercase, which is not necessary, because all the genres in the file are uppercase,
so it is not going to cause errors.


- write_file function
Our code uses a string:
output_file.write(t[0] + ', ' + str(t[1]) + '\n')

While AI one uses a formatted string:
file.write(f"{title}, {rating:.1f}\n")

This doesn’t change the output though.

ChatGPT didn't use any unnecessary libraries or modules. It's code didn't work at first,
Due to it splitting the code by '\t' instead of ';'. This wasn't hard to fix, however.
I tested the following functions to make sure the code works as intended:

print(read_file('films.csv', 2014)[:2])
print(top_n(read_file('films.csv', 2014), 'Action', 5))
write_file(top_n(read_file('films.csv', 2014), 'Action', 5), 'example')

It wasn't necessary to use any of the tactics from previous lessons.
